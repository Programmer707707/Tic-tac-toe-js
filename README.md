## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using vanilla JavaScript for logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.

## Features

- Two players: X and O.
- Alternate turns between players.
- Winner detection based on standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules.
- Announcements for the winner or a tie.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the empty tiles to make your move.
3. The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
4. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
